# A Solubility Model Web Application
Welcome! In this project, I train a solubility model and deploy it as a web app. 
I use data provided by [Lowe _et. al._ (2023)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36877669/).
I was inspired by the tutorial and code from [Data Professor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0sePkuyTKs&list=PLtqF5YXg7GLlQJUv9XJ3RWdd5VYGwBHrP&index=9).

You can use the app [here](https://ismolsol.streamlit.app).

So far, I have trained a very simple and crude classification model around 0.001 M (or mol/L) cutoff value, meaning that compounds with solubility < 0.001 are insoluble.
Model returns '0' for insoluble and '1' for soluble compounds. I used Python for training the model and Streamlit for building the web app.
I was inspired by the tutorial and code from Data Professor and shared the link to his YouTube video in the references section.

## What's next?
(Edited on April 15, 2024)
#2. Create a Power Point presentation to explain what the app is, what has been done so far, and what is the road map.

#1. The next step is to deploy the app using Flask or Heroku.
- The app is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud
- Created a continuous machine learning (CML) pipeline using Github Actions
- Used Data Version Control (DVC) for data & model versioning and data science experimentation
- Used AWS S3 bucket to store the model
 
Stay tuned!
